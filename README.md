## Introduction

Welcome to our Souls Game Role-Playing Game (RPG), where brave heroes face off against various monsters in intense combat. In this epic journey, battles are governed by individual actions and are based on a series of attributes, including life points, stamina, equipped weapons, armor, and more.

## Combat Mechanics

### Attributes

1. **Life Points (Life):** Represents the health of the hero. Damage taken during battles reduces life points.
2. **Stamina:** Determines the hero's ability to perform actions. Actions typically consume stamina, and when it's depleted, certain actions become unavailable.
3. **Weapon:** The equipped weapon influences the power and type of attacks the hero can unleash.
4. **Armor:** The armor worn provides protection against incoming attacks.

### Combat Actions

- **Attack:** Deals damage to the enemy, considering the weapon's power, armor, and a chance element based on the precision of the strike.
- **Defense:** Raises the hero's defenses, reducing damage taken.
- **Special Abilities:** Unique skills that heroes can use strategically during battles.

### Combat Outcome

- **Winning:** Successfully defeating a monster rewards the hero with loot, including armor pieces, weapons, and potions for stamina and life regeneration.
- **Losing:** Failing in combat may result in the loss of some loot or other penalties.

## Inventory System

The loot obtained during battles is stored in an inventory. The inventory is subject to various rules and limitations, adding an extra layer of strategy to the game. Players must manage their inventory efficiently to optimize their chances of survival.

## Goal

The ultimate objective is for the hero to survive by defeating all monsters encountered throughout the game. As the hero progresses, the challenges become more formidable, requiring strategic thinking, resource management, and mastery of combat mechanics.

Embark on this perilous journey and test your skills in a world inspired by the legendary Dark Souls series. May your hero conquer the darkness and emerge victorious against all odds!
